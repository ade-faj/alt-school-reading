computer sciencey. The new
seven big ideas at the core of computer science — creativity, abstraction, data, algorithms, programming, Internet and impact — that are
fundamental to computer science, but applicable to analysis in many disciplines.



40 concepts of computer science
1. Algorithms and Data Structures: 
    an algorithm is a step-by-step procedure to resolve any problem. 
    An algorithm is an effective method expressed as a finite set of well-defined instructions.

a. Big O Notation
    input does not affect  output O(1), output is directly proportional to input O(n).
    big O notation helps you to analyze the scalability and efficiency of algorithms.
    represents the worst-case scenario of an algorithm

b. Sorting Algorithms 
    Insertion, Selection, Bubble, Shell, Merge, Heap, Quick

c. Recursion
    reoccuring. Droste effect. A nurse is carrying a tray with a box of cocoa and a cup containing a smaller image of her holding the same thing, which in turn contains an even smaller version of the image, and so on.

d. Big Data
    Big data describes data sets so large and complex that is impossible to manage with conventional data processing tools.

e. Data Structures
    Array, Tree, Stack, Queue, Graph, Hash Table, Linked List, Heap

2. Artificial Intelligence

a. Greedy Algorithm
    taking the first simple way that comes to mind instead of analyzing all possible outcomes first.

b. Hill Climbing 
    The hill climbing algorithm attempts to find a better solution by generating a neighboring solution. 
    Each neighboring solution is generated based on the best solution so far, with a single element modified.
    - random-restart hill climbing

c. Simulated Annealing
    careful climbing, proper strategies

d. Dynamic Programming
    memoization (yes memoization not memorization), a top-down approach in dynamic programming, which store the results of previous computations for future use.

e. Machine Learning
