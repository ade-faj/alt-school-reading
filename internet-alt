Alternatively referred to as the net or web, the Internet (interconnected network) was initially developed to aid in the progress of computing technology by linking academic computer centers. 
The Internet we use today started being developed in the late 1960s with the start of ARPANET and transmitted its first message on Friday, October 29, 1969. 
In 1993, the Internet experienced one of its largest growths to date and today is accessible by people all over the world.
The WWW is explored using a browser and the act of browsing the Internet is commonly referred to as surfing.
Users browse websites and web pages by following hyperlinks that point to an address more commonly referred to as a URL(Uniform Resource Locators)
Finding information on the Internet is achieved using a search engine.
The Internet utilizes the TCP/IP(Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) protocol and is accessed using a dial-up modem, broadband, 3G, 4G, or network connected through an ISP(Internet service provider).wireless fidelity(wifi), File Transfer Protocol(ftp)

In the Beginning ...
There was Al Gore, chief architect supreme of the internet.
Nikola Tesla describing a "World Wireless System"
researchers coming up with plans for searchable media databases in the '30s and '40s
Cold War - Out of fear that the Soviets could destroy America's telephone system (thereby rendering long-distance communication impossible), the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) began looking for alternatives.
M.I.T. scientist J.C.R. Licklider came up with a solution in 1962: an "intergalactic computer network" that would allow for communication on a global scale - 
in order to make it happen, they came up with a new technology: packet switching.
    like the nation's telephone system -- relied on analog, circuit-switching technology
    uses IP address: a unique, numerical label that distinguishes one host from another.
    TCP is responsible for dividing data into packets at one end of a transmission and reassembling those packets at the other end.

Modern TCP/IP networks use four distinct layers in order to transmit data, and that data always moves from one layer to the next.

First, there's the application layer, which is responsible for interfacing with computer applications such as web browsers and email clients.
Second, there's the transport layer. This layer is where the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) goes to work dividing data into packets (and, on the receiving end, it reassembles that data).
Third, we have the internet layer, where the Internet Protocol (IP) assigns address information and determines the route the data will take.
Finally, we have the network layer, wherein physical hardware actually carries the data via wire, fiber, radio etc.

software engineer Tim Berners-Lee, who first proposed the concept of a World Wide Web in 1989. By the end of 1990, he had successfully launched the first web page.

the key ingredients of the World Wide Web:
- HyperText Markup Language (HTML): This is the standard protocol for publishing content on the web. It's used to format text and multimedia documents as well as link between documents.
- Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Just like every computer on the internet gets a unique identifier in the form of an IP address, every resource on the World Wide Web gets a unique identifier in the form of a URI. The most common type of URI is the Uniform Resource Locator, or URL (also known as a "web address"). 
- HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP): HTTP is responsible for requesting and transmitting web pages. When you enter a URL into a web browser, you're actually initiating a HTTP command to go find and retrieve the web page specified by that URL. In relation to a TCP/IP network, HTTP is part of the application layer, as specific applications -- namely, web browsers and web servers -- use HTTP to communicate with one another.
